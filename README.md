NHL Stats API Integration Into Home Assistant
## Objectives
* Consume undocumented NHL Stats API locally with the least amount of resources possible.
* Pass information to Home Assistant as sensor data (ex. Next game scheduled, live scores or recent scores, goal description, etc.)
* Create a "goal" event platform to use as a trigger for automations.
